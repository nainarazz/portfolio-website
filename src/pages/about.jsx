                        Since I was small, I have been fascinated by computers. I have liked video
                        games in particular and I have dreamed of working with them one day. Up
                        until now, however, I have not made a simple game ðŸ˜Š. I came across web
                        development later in my life and I enjoyed it. It is just beautiful with
                        what you can do with browsers today, so I have decided to have my career
                        built around web development.

                        I have studied Software Engineering in Kampala, Uganda, and shortly after
                        graduating (2017), I got my first job as a software developer in a large
                        software consulting company. Now I am working with a software startup
                        developing web applications (please see my resume for my working
                        experience). I mainly use JavaScript across the whole stack. Here are the
                        technologies I have worked with.
